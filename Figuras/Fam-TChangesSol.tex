P1 & A \emph{dependent/independent variable} is suppressed or added. The \emph{operationalization dimension} is modified; no \emph{threat to validity} is identified. &  \textbf{Modify the template} so that the L-pattern allows you to specify that the change does not affect any \emph{threat to validity}. \\ \hline



P2 & The  \emph{reason for the change}  is not specified.  & The use of the template avoids this missing information. \\ \hline
P3 & The  \emph{name of the modified variable} is unknown. The change modifies the  \emph{operationalization dimension}.  & The use of the template avoids this missing information. \\ \hline
%T5 & It is not clear whether the change affects the operationalization or protocol dimension & The modified dimension is not identified \\ \hline
%T6 & It is not clear which element of the protocol dimension is affected by the change & The affected element is not identified \\ \hline
%T7 & The change modifies the protocol dimension & The affected element  is the change in the order of actions. This element is new \\ \hline

%P4 & The change consists of \emph{"alter the sequence of steps"}. It does not fit into any of the elements of the \emph{protocol dimension}. & \textbf{Modify the metamodel} to add the \emph{"sequence of steps"} as one of the possible elements to modify in the \emph{protocol dimension}.  \\ \hline

P4 & The change consists of modifying a \emph{context variable}. The affected dimension is not identified.  & \textbf{Modify the metamodel} considering \emph{context variables} included in the \emph{operationalization dimension}. Therefore, it also implies \textbf{modifying the template}. \\ \hline
