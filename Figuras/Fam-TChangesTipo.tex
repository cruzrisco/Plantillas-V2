%T1 & It is a change in the level (factor) of the independent variable (operationalization dimension) but it can also be considered a change in the protocol dimension\\ \hline
T2 & A dependent variable is suppressed or added.  The operationalization dimension is modified but no threat to validity is identified. \\ \hline
T3 & A independent variable is suppressed or added.  The operationalization dimension is modified but no validity threat is identified. \\ \hline
T4 & It's a compound change. It is convenient its decomposition in simple changes \\ \hline
T5 & It is not clear whether the change affects the operationalization or protocol dimension \\ \hline
T6 & The change modifies the protocol dimension; the affected element is not identified \\ \hline
T7 & The change modifies the protocol dimension; the affected element  is the change in the order of actions. This element is new \\ \hline
T8 & The change modifies the operationalization dimension; the affected variable is not identified
