%\section{Analysis of the changes}
This section discusses the difficulties encountered in defining each change using the proposed template. Specifically, it analyses: i) if the changes lead or not to modifications in
12
 the template and ii) main lacks of information found when describing changes.

%\textcolor[rgb]{1,0,0}{Quitar ?.} Table \ref{tab:changesMI} shows the data related to the changes in the replication of the \textit {Mindfulness} experiment.
%For each change, the acronym of the replication and the original, an identifier of the change and a brief description appear. It also includes the difficulty in describing the change according to the table \ref{tab:tipos}.
%It can be seen that 100\% of the changes fit the template.

%\textcolor[rgb]{1,0,0}{Quitar ?.} Table \ref{tab:changesALE} shows data to changes in the family of \textit{Requirements analysis} experiments. Of the 33 changes included, 6 have been fully defined according to the template. 
%\textcolor[rgb]{1,0,0}{Quitar ?.} Table \ref{tab:changesVV} shows data to changes in the series of experiments on  \textit{Code evaluation techniques}. In this series, 9 of the 22 changes have been defined without difficulty. In the rest, there has been some difficulty in specifying some fields, such as the modified dimension, the threat affected or the reason for the change.

Table \ref{tab:agrupa} totals the changes defined fitting the template and those that have presented difficulties.
By analyzing this table, two types of situations can be identified:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Due to limitations in the template}. Implies a change in the template (e.g. modify the L-pattern in case the threat is not identified). Some of these situations result in changes in the metamodel.
\item  \textbf{Due to lack of information}. This situation does not imply changes in the template.  It supports the idea that the template is necessary so that applications are not \textbf{under-specified}.
%This situation does not imply changes in the template and supports the idea that using the template the changes are not under specified.

\end{itemize}
\textbf{Main lacks of information found when describing the changes.}  
Due to the difficulty of their specification, some of the fields of the template are optional.  In the three families analysed, among the fields not specified by the authors, \emph{reason for the change introduced} and \emph{validity threats addressed} stand out.   
%two of the fields that present difficulties to be filled in are the \emph{reason for the change} and \emph{the validity threats addressed}.
However, these fields are easily identifiable by the researchers who participate in the replication and fill in the template.

This leads us to reinforce the template by making the fields that were optional mandatory so that this information is not missing.
%Although in some cases it is not specified, it is important to make clear both the purpose of the replication and the reason for each change introduced.  In the template, for the purpose of replication, allows you to choose between three possible prefixed values.
The \textbf{reason for the change} is described by a L-pattern.

In order to facilitate the selection of the \textbf{validity threat addressed}, in \cite{gomez2014understanding} the threats are identified based on changes in the experimental baseline.

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Changing the experimenters} does not control any threat. It only ensures that the experimenters do not influence the results \cite{Juristo2012}.
\item \emph{Changing the protocol:} Internal validity is addressed. Results are independent of experimental conditions.
\item \emph{Changing the operationalization:} Construct validity is addressed. %Determine limits for Operationalizations (range of variation of treatments and measures used ) \cite{Juristo2012}.
\item \emph{Changing the population:} External validity is addressed. %Determine limits in the population properties \cite{Juristo2012}.
