    Change \textit{5}   & \textbf{Originally}, there were 6 treatments corresponding to the 3 levels of Cu and with/without \emph{surfactant} (to facilitate Cu extraction). There were 2 soils and 2 types of plants. This represents 24 experimental units (3x2x2x2). For each experimental unit, 3 pots were prepared. In total there are 72 pots (3x2x2x2x3) \\
    
    & \textbf{In replication}, there were 2 treatments corresponding to with/without \emph{surfactant}. There were 3 soils and 1 type of plant. This represents 6 experimental units. Each experimental unit was repeated 4 times (2x3x4 pots) forming a block. This is repeated 3 times to have 3 blocks. In total there are 72 pots (2x3x4x3). 
    Within each block, pots are randomly distributed. The experimental unit is the pot.

 Change \textit{6}   & \textbf{Originally}, the biomass is collected when the plants have between 2 and 3 true leaves \\& \textbf{In replication}, the plants are rinsed when they have between 2 and 3 real leaves and only 1 plant is left by pot. The biomass is collected when the plants reach the fructification stage. \\& \textbf{In order to}  avoid competition between plants, let the plants complete their vegetative cycle and thus obtain more biomass \\
