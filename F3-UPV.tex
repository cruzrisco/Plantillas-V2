%%%%   
    Change \textit{1}   & \textbf{Originally}, the three verification and validation techniques are used: code reading, equivalence partitioning and branch testing \\& \textbf{In replication} the code reading technique is omitted  \\& \textbf{because of} time constraints \\
    
     Modified Dimension & 
   \textbf{Operationalization}, specifically the independent variable \textit {technique} \\ 
    Threat to validity & The change increases the construct validity \\  
    Comment & The baseline experiment are UPM replications treated as one 
    \\ \hline
    %%%%   
    Change \textit{2}  & \textbf{Originally}, the duration of the 3 sessions is 4h. each, i.e. the time is unlimited \\& \textbf{In replication} the duration of each of the 3 sessions is 2h. \\& \textbf{because of} time constraints \\
    
    
    Modified Dimension & 
   \textbf{Protocol}, specifically the guides  \\ 
    Threat to validity & The change increases the internal validity \\  \hline
    
     %%%%   
    Change \textit{3}   & \textbf{Originally}, subjects receive three four-hour training sessions to learn how to apply the techniques   \\& \textbf{In replication} the training consists of two two-hour tutorials \\& \textbf{because} he subjects are already familiar with the techniques \\

   \textbf{Operationalization}, specifically the independent variable  \textit {training} \\ 
    Threat to validity & The change increases the construct validity \\ \hline
    
    %%%%   
    Change \textit{4}   & \textbf{Originally},the training in the use of the techniques is before the experiment is executed \\& \textbf{In replication} Each tutorial is carried out before the application of the technique, in the first 2 sessions; i. e., the training is interspersed with the operation of the experiment \\& \textbf{because} he subjects are already familiar with the techniques \\

    %%%%   
    Change \textit{5}   & \textbf{Originally}, subjects apply a technique to a program in each session \\& \textbf{In replication} subjects apply the same technique to different programs in each session \\& \textbf{because of} time constraints \\

    Modified Dimension & 
   \textbf{Protocol}, specifically the guides  \\ 
    Threat to validity & The change increases the internal validity \\  \hline
    
    %%%%   
    Change \textit{6}   & \textbf{Originally}, The subjects execute test cases with the application of the technique; that is to say in each session \\& \textbf{In replication} Subjects run test cases for one of the programs they have tested in a separate session, i.e. in session 3 \\& \textbf{because of} time constraints \\
