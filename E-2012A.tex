%%%%   
    Change \textit{1}   & \textbf{Originally}, knowledge is defined as familiarity through subjective assessment\\& \textbf{In replication} knowledge is defined as an independent variable with two levels: known and unknown problem \\& \textbf{because of} in the experimental population (post-graduate students) it is possible to know whether or not they know a certain domain of the problem \\
    
    Modified Dimension & 
   \textbf{Operationalization}, specifically the independent variable \textit {knowledge} \\ 
    Threat to validity  & The change ***(\textbf{\textit{Threat}}) \\ \hline
  
%%%%
    Change \textit{2}   & \textbf{Originally}, the interviews to know the requirements are carried out on two different days, to avoid fatigue in the experimenter \\& \textbf{In replication} the design is changed to a design of repeated measurements (within-subjects) \\& \textbf{because of} this design does not require a large number of subjects \\ 

    Modified Dimension & 
   \textbf{Protocol}, specifically the experimental design  \\ 
    Threat to validity & The change increases the internal validity \\  \hline
    
%%%%
 
     Change \textit{3}   & \textbf{Originally}, interviews between subjects (analysts) and experimenters are in groups \\& \textbf{In replication} interviews are individual  \\.  
    & \textbf{because of} there are two experimenters (responders) with two languages \\ 

    Modified Dimension & 
    \textbf{Protocol}, specifically the guides \\   
    Threat to validity & The change increases the internal validity  \\  \hline

%%%%
    Change \textit{4}   & \textbf{Originally}, there are no blocking variables \\& \textbf{In replication} there is a blocking variable per language \\& \textbf{because of} subjects who use their mother tongue will be more effective than subjects who use a second language  \\ 

     Modified Dimension & 
   \textbf{Protocol}, specifically the experimental design  \\ 
    Threat to validity & The change increases the internal validity \\  \hline
    
    %%%%
    Change \textit{5}   & \textbf{Originally}, there are no blocking variables \\& \textbf{In replication} there is one blocking variable per experimenter (respondent) \\& \textbf{because} experimental subjects conduct the interview in their own language.  \\ 

     Modified Dimension & 
   \textbf{Protocol}, specifically the experimental design  \\ 
    Threat to validity & The change increases the internal validity \\  \hline
    
     %%%%
    Change \textit{6}   & \textbf{Originally}, there is a experimenter (respondent) \\& \textbf{In replication} there are two experimenters (respondents) \\& \textbf{In order to} alleviate the effects of fatigue and learning of the experimenter (respondents)  \\ 

     Modified Dimension & 
    \textbf{Protocol}, specifically the guides \\
