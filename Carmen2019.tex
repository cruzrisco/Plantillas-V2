  Replication &   \textbf{\emph{Soil-2019}}   Internal replication based on \textbf{\emph{Soil-2016}}  original experiment   \\
     
 Description \newline of experiment &  To evaluate the effect of a bio-surfactant on the assisted phytoremediation of contaminated soil \\  
 
 Site and Date & The base experiment was carried out in  \textit{ETSIA-University of Seville}  in  \textit{October 2015} and this replication, in  \textit{ETSIA-University of Seville} in \textit{March 2019}    \\
    Purpose  &  Extend results \\  
\hline   
%%%%  
    Change \textit{1}   & \textbf{Originally}, the experiment was carried out in a cultivation chamber \\& \textbf{In replication}, was carried out in a greenhouse \\& \textbf{In order to} simulate natural conditions \\
    
    Modified Dimension & 
    \textbf{Population}, specifically experimental objects  \\   
    Threat to validity  & The change increases the external validity \\
    & since it allows to generalize the results performing the replication in conditions closer to the natural ones \\  \hline
  
%%%%
    Change \textit{2}   & \textbf{Originally}, two types of plants were used: \emph{Hordeum vulgare} L. and \emph{Brassica juncea} L. \\& \textbf{In replication}, only \emph{Brassica juncea} L. was used \\& \textbf{Because} in the original experiment it was demonstrated that only \emph{Brassica juncea} L. was a metal accumulator plant\\  

    Modified Dimension & 
    \textbf{Protocol}, specifically experimental
    material \\   
    Threat to validity  & The change does not affect validity  \\  \hline
%%%%
 
    Change \textit{3}   & \textbf{Originally}, there were two types of soil: Coria (pH=7.8) and Constantina (pH=5.5) \\& \textbf{In replication}, there were three types of soil: Miraflores-1 (pH=x, Pb=158 y Zn=125, Cu=36) and Miraflores-2 (pH=y, Pb=375 Zn=192 Cu=206) and Lebrija (not contaminated by metals) \\& \textbf{In order to}  experiment with naturally contaminated soils. Miraflores soils are urban gardens with natural contamination and Lebrija soil was used as control\\  

     Modified Dimension & 
    \textbf{Protocol}, specifically experimental
    material \\   
    Threat to validity  & The change increase external validity since it allows to generalize the results in natural soils
    \\  \hline

%%%%
    Change \textit{4}   & \textbf{Originally}, Copper (Cu) doses were 0, 500 and 1000 mg $kg^{-1}$ applied as Copper Nitrate\\& \textbf{In replication}, the soils are not artificially contaminated with Cu
    \\& \textbf{Because of} these soils are urban orchard-gardens with natural pollution (Cu levels 36 and 206 mg $kg^{-1}$)
    \\  
 
    Modified Dimension & 
    \textbf{Operationalization}, specifically independent variable dosisCu\\   
    Threat to validity  & The change increase external validity since it allows to generalize the results in natural soils\\
