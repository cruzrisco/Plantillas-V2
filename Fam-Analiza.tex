%\textcolor[rgb]{1,0,0}{Quitar ?.} Table \ref{tab:changesMI} shows the data related to the changes in the replication of the \textit {Mindfulness} experiment.
%For each change, the acronym of the replication and the original, an identifier of the change and a brief description appear. It also includes the difficulty in describing the change according to the table \ref{tab:tipos}.
%It can be seen that 100\% of the changes fit the template.

%\textcolor[rgb]{1,0,0}{Quitar ?.} Table \ref{tab:changesALE} shows data to changes in the family of \textit{Requirements analysis} experiments. Of the 33 changes included, 6 have been fully defined according to the template. 
%\textcolor[rgb]{1,0,0}{Quitar ?.} Table \ref{tab:changesVV} shows data to changes in the series of experiments on  \textit{Code evaluation techniques}. In this series, 9 of the 22 changes have been defined without difficulty. In the rest, there has been some difficulty in specifying some fields, such as the modified dimension, the threat affected or the reason for the change.


%Although in some cases it is not specified, it is important to make clear both the purpose of the replication and the reason for each change introduced.  In the template, for the purpose of replication, allows you to choose between three possible prefixed values.
