    Change \textit{1}   & \textbf{Originally}, two problem domains are used in the experiment, one known domain (DC) and the other unknown domain (DD) \\& \textbf{In replication} the problem domains used in the experiment have been modified, but one is still a known domain (DC) and the other is an unknown domain (DD) \\& \textbf{because of} ***(\textbf{\textit{Reason}})\\

    Change \textit{2}   & \textbf{Originally}, first the known domain problem is performed and then the unknown domain problem. \\& \textbf{In replication} the order of the problems is swapped \\& \textbf{because of} ***(\textbf{\textit{Reason}})\\

     Threat to validity & The change increases the construct validity  \\  
    %Threat to validity & The change does not affect the validity  \\ %&  \textbf{because} change the timing of the experiment. It does not involve changing the way treatment is applied or changing metrics and measurement procedures for the same response variable \\
