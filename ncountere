\section{Analysis of the changes}
This section discusses the difficulties encountered in defining each change using the proposed template.
%or whether the change fits the template. 
%according to the template and language patterns defined. Table \ref{tab:changes}. 
Table \ref{tab:tipos} typifies these problems including the T0 type when the change fits the template.

Table \ref{tab:changesMI} shows the data related to the changes in the replication of the Mindfulness experiment.
For each change, the acronym of the replication and the base experiment, an identifier and a brief description of the change appear. It also includes the difficulty in describing the change according to the table \ref{tab:tipos}.
It can be seen that 100\% of the changes fit the template.

Table \ref{tab:changesALE} shows data to changes in the family of Requirements analysis experiments. Of the 33 changes included, only 7 have been defined without problems

Table \ref{tab:changesVV} shows data to changes in the series of experiments on Code evaluation techniques.
