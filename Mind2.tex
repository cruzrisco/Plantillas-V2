    Change \textit{1}   & \textbf{Originally}, for 4 weeks Mindfulness was practiced 4 days a week in 10-minute sessions \\& \textbf{In replication} In replication the sessions were 12 minutes long and for 6 weeks \\& \textbf{in order to}  make more evident the benefits of Mindfulness \\

    %Threat to validity & The change not affect the validity   \\& \textbf{because} only the dose of the treatment applied changes \\\hline
  
   Change \textit{\#2}   &  \textbf{Originally}, the assignment of subjects to treatment was not randomized 
   \\& \textbf{In replication} it becomes random  \\&
    \textbf{in order to} remedy threats to the internal validity of quasi-experiments\\
  
Modified Dimension & \textbf{Protocol}, specifically experimental design \\  
Threat to validity  &  The change increases the internal validity    \\
%& \textbf{because} the results are independent of the protocol \\

 Change \textit{\#3}   &  \textbf{Originally}, an public speaking workshop was given to the control group as a placebo
   \\& \textbf{In replication} the oratory workshop took place after the experiment  \\&
    \textbf{in order to} avoid a possible effect of such a workshop on the measurements of dependent variables\\
