%In the present work, [Wieringa]
Design Science Research (DSR) is adopted as a research methodology. DSR creates and evaluates \emph{artefacts} in order to solve \emph{identified organizational problems} \cite{von2004design}. The phases followed in our research are those defined in the DSR methodology proposed in \cite{Vaishnavi}. Table \ref{tab:fases} shows these phases and their correspondence with the sections of this article.

%DRS requires a deep understanding of the problem to be solved, the consequences to be alleviated and the causes to be avoided [O. D´ıaz, J. P. Contell, and J. R. Venable. Strategic].


%It is a web application that allows users to visualize and share their thoughts in the form of mind maps (Quote Wikipedia). Specifically, DScaffolding (Design Science Scaffolding) is used, a mental map template for DSR projects [J. P. Contell, O. D´ıaz, and J. R. Venable. Dscaffolding]. This template consists of a set of tagged nodes that can be expanded by adding new child nodes. DScaffolding is available as a Chrome plug-in.

%understanding the problem and defining its Causes and Consequence.
%The proposed artefact is a template, i.e., a method for reporting changes in replications. In the present work, the evaluation phase of the proposal is included, which consists of the evaluation of the template by means of its use in three series of experiments.
